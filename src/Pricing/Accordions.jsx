    Whenever you purchase (eg book tickets) or make an online payment, it needs to be securely processed and verified by a third party payment processor. <br/> 
  <ListItem>These processors include Banks (for netbanking, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS transactions), Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Rupay etc (for credit and debit card transactions),  Paytm, UPI apps and other payment wallets who charge a small fee for this service (‘payment gateway charges’).  These charges on crowdfunding websites are unavoidable.</ListItem>
  <ListItem>This is NOT Milaap fees. These fees go directly to the payment processor and help us keep Milaap a safe place to donate.
Payment gateways charge their fees as a % of donation amount made. It varies based on the mode of payment and service provider.</ListItem><br/>

    Yes, Milaap charges NO platform fees for individuals, NGOs and organizations alike. In fact, organizations with 80G tax-exempt status<br/>
     also have the option to either issue tax-exemption receipts from Milaap's dashboard or issue it separately. Receipts to donors from <br/>
      Milaap's dashboard can be issued, at a click of a button. This feature is FREE to use and entails NO FEES.

    Over 98% of Milaap’s fundraisers which have raised money do it for FREE using our best-in-class social fundraising technology and <br/>
     round-the-clock assistance and support from our relationship managers.<br/><br/>
     In certain scenarios, where the beneficiaries come from a disadvantaged backgrounds with no digital literacy, exhausted most of their<br/>
     finances with no other sources available and require funds very urgently; Milaap may consider them on a case-by-case basis for<br/>
     outreach on social media and digital promotion platforms after verification and a signed request letter from the beneficiary. This is<br/>
     subject to availability of our team members, and situations where we believe promotions can achieve something significant for the<br/>
     cause.<br/><br/>
     Similar to payment gateway costs where it's paid to payment processor, outreach costs are paid towards social media and digital<br/>
      promotion platforms. To ensure that donor money goes primarily to the intended purpose, we cap the outreach costs to not more than<br/>
       15% of funds raised. Please note that Milaap doesn't earn / keep any additional fee or commission for itself from the costs incurred <br/>
        through promotions.
